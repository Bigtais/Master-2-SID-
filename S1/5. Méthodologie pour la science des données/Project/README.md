# Predictive Mass Prediction Project

## Overview

This project involves working with a dataset containing simulation measurements from 15 sensors to predict the mass of an element X in a container. The dataset comprises data from 104 different simulations, with features including container number, mass (target variable), and signals from 15 sensors (det1 to det15). The goal is to develop an efficient and scalable MLOps pipeline for automating the machine learning workflow.

## Project Structure

### 1. Version Control and Data Versioning

- **Git:** Employ Git for version control to manage code changes collaboratively.
- **DVC (Data Version Control):** Use DVC for tracking and managing dataset versions. 
### 2. Experiment Tracking

- **MLflow:** Utilize MLflow for logging experiments, managing model versions, and tracking performance.

### 3. Model Training and Deployment

- **Automated Model Training:** Develop automation for model training.
- **Web Service Deployment:** Deploy the trained model as a web service using Flask API.

### 4. Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Model Monitoring:** Implement monitoring for the deployed model to track performance.
- **Model Maintenance:** Regularly update and maintain the model based on performance metrics.

## Tasks

### 1. Data Exploration

- **Load and Explore Dataset:** Use Python (Pandas, NumPy) to load and explore the dataset.
- **Feature Understanding:** Understand the features and their characteristics.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- **Data Cleaning:** Perform necessary data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Feature Engineering:** Conduct feature engineering to enhance model performance.

### 3. Model Development

- **Choose ML Models:** Select appropriate machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, Random Forest, MLPRegressor).
- **Implement and Train Models:** Train the selected models using the dataset.

### 4. Model Evaluation

- **Metrics Evaluation:** Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (MSE, R2_Score).
- **Cross-Validation:** Perform cross-validation to assess model robustness.

### 5. Result Analysis and Reporting

- **Results Analysis:** Analyze the results and extract insights.
- **Project Documentation:** Prepare a detailed report documenting the approach, results, milestones, and conclusions.
